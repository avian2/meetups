    * [ ] When done click `Publish` and then `Announce it now` so members of the user group are notified by email about the upcoming meetup.

# Announce the meetup

Wait a few days. If there are no sponsors and/or speakers that have stepped up, you will have to manually poke them to do so. Go through the list of potential [talks](https://github.com/ljpy/meetups/issues/1) and [sponsors](https://github.com/ljpy/meetups/issues/1). For speakers and sponsors, the rule is First-Come-First-Served: whoever comments on #1 or #2 first, gets to be the speaker/sponsor. Once you have a sponsor and two talks, continue with:

* [ ] Go to https://www.meetup.com/Ljubljana-Python-Group/, click on the upcoming meetup and post the following:
    ```

# Narrate the meetup

* [ ] Come to Poligon 20 minutes before the start of the meetup.
* [ ] Open up the Meetup.com event page on the projector so that new people know they are in the right place.
* [ ] Decide on a provisional date for next meetup.
* [ ] Ask each speaker for a sentence or two about who they are and what they do. Tell them you need this so you can introduce them.
* [ ] Coordinate with speakers who will go first.
* [ ] If the sponsor is attending, ask them to prepare a 3 minute pitch about what they do and (potentially) who they are looking for.
* [ ] The schedule is normally something along these lines. Feel free to improvise:
  * [ ] "Raise hand if you are new to this meetup".
  * [ ] "Raise hand if you are new to Python".
  * [ ] Introduce the sponsor and give them 3 minutes for their pitch.
  * [ ] Cross out when you take a beer!
  * [ ] Introduce speaker 1.
  * [ ] Take a photo during talk 1.
  * [ ] Introduce speaker 2.
  * [ ] Take a photo during talk 2.
  * [ ] Thank speakers.
  * [ ] Open http://lmorillas.github.io/python_events, "raise hands who is going".
  * [ ] "We need talks: beginners welcome! web, mobile, desktop, embedded, big data, everything goes!"
  * [ ] "We need sponsors: give back to the community!"
  * [ ] "Provisional date for next meetup, raise hands".
  * [ ] "Raise hands who is looking for work? Stand up who is hiring? Mingle!"

# Follow up

* [ ] Post photos to https://www.meetup.com/Ljubljana-Python-Group/
