# Python Meetups in Ljubljana

A somewhat monthly get-together of Pythonistas from Ljubljana, Slovenia, EU, with a talk or two, sometimes a [Ligthning Talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) session and discussions over sponsored beer afterwards. Non-slovenian-speaking attendees welcome as most of the talks are in English!
